# This is the Most **Important** Code on GitHub

You will probably remember this day for the rest of your life: it's the day you finally get to experience this earth-shattering food/calories API for the very first time. #blessed

This database has over two distinct foods with their corresponding calories, and that number will inevitably continue to grow (if you test the POST endpoint).

## Endpoints
